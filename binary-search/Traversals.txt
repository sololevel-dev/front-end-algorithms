ðŸ”„ Traversals ARE part of the Binary Search Tree concept â€” they are how we visit all the nodes in the tree, usually to read or process the data.

ðŸŒ³ What Is Tree Traversal?
Traversal means visiting every node in the tree exactly once, in a specific order.

look at this tree
        10
       /  \
      5    15
     / \     \
    2   7     20

1. In-order (left â†’ root â†’ right)

Visit left, then current, then right
This gives sorted order in BST!
Result: 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20

2. Pre-order (root â†’ left â†’ right)

Visit current, then left, then right
Used for copying or saving the tree
Result: 10, 5, 2, 7, 15, 20

3. Post-order (left â†’ right â†’ root)

Visit left, then right, then current
Useful for deleting a tree safely
Result: 2, 7, 5, 20, 15, 10

| Traversal Type | Order             | Use Case             |
| -------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| In-order       | Left, Root, Right | Get sorted values    |
| Pre-order      | Root, Left, Right | Save/copy the tree   |
| Post-order     | Left, Right, Root | Delete tree safely   |
| Level-order    | Level by level    | Breadth-first search |
